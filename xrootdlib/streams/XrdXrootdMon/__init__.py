"""
Stream of the XrdXrootdMon monitoring messages

This module presents a high-level stream representation of the :py:mod:`~xrootdlib.structs.XrdXrootdMon`
``struct`` primitives.
It provides two stream mechanisms of different complexity:

* :py:class:`~.stream_packets` provides an ordered stream of raw :py:class:`~.Packet`
* :py:class:`~.map_streams` provides a stream of
  :py:mod:`~.fstat`, :py:mod:`~.redir`, :py:mod:`~.trace`, and :py:mod:`~.map`

    The ``packet_source`` may be any bytes buffer supporting ``read`` operations.

    The ``sort_window`` is required to ensure ordering of the packet data.
    Since XRootD uses several packet buffers, concurrent packets may arrive in arbitrary order.
    To remove this ambiguity, ``sort_window`` packets are buffered and provided in order.

    Note that an ideal ``sort_window`` corresponds to the *number* of out-of-order packets.
    It is *not* to the maximum difference in ordering of each packet.

    Provides a high-level representation of monitoring packets, resolving dependencies

    This provides a :py:mod:`chainlet` stream of primitives corresponding to monitoring records.
    The stream multiplexes up to four types of monitoring streams:

    :py:mod:`~.fstat` - sequence of :py:class:`~.fstat.FstatWindow`
        High level file operations, namely open, close, transfer and disconnects.

    :py:mod:`~.redir` - sequence of :py:class:`~.redir.RedirWindow`
        Client redirection for all high-level actions, such as read, write, move, chmod, etc.

    :py:mod:`~.trace` - sequence of :py:class:`~.trace.TraceWindow`
        Low level file operations, including individual read/write requests.

    :py:mod:`~.map` - individual :py:class:`~.map.MapInfo`
        High level information on servers, clients and paths.
        This information is automatically inserted into appropriate records of the sequence streams.
